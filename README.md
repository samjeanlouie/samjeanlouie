# **Welcome Everyone** ðŸ¦–

My name is Sam Jeanlouie. I'm 16 years old. I'm a part time student at RVCC. I'm working towards a dual major in Biology and International Business while also working towards a certificate in Web Design and Interface. The other half of my schooling is at Watchung Hills Regional High School. If I'm not in school or studying, I'm either working, in the gym/playing basketball, coaching, or working on expanding my small businesses.

I currently workat Zumiez in the Bridgewater Commons Mall. I'm also applying to work at various other establishments such as Shoprite and Panera. Working has always been my positive way of socializing and meeting new people.

Working out and playing basketball are also good outlets for me. Basketball always created a community for me that encouraged me to strive and grow. People able to watch my muscle progression or learning new ways to be a successful player have always brought me great joy.

Coaching young girls the sport that has given me life has always been a great honor. I never really had any mentor growing up, and I've always tried to be that on and off the court for my girls. I love watching grow and succeed. I love spreading the knowledge I've learned to these girls and being a positive influence on them.

I have 2 small business. One is called SWAG '06. It stands for

(**W**)orry not

We are a skate brand that sells clothing and custom shoes and skateboards. We also stand for people who can't have their own voices. An organiztion that we are a fierce long time supporter of is SPTS (The Society for the Prevention of Teen Suicide). We also work with various other organizations to help out various communities of people.

The other business is much less independent. I travel and do giveaways for the company Zumiez to advertise. I've been as far as Texas and get the opportunity to meet the managers of the various stores. It's awesome to see because no 2 Zumiez stores have the same setup, most aren't even close. It's like a new community with every store you visit. 

The greatest thing I feel I possess is my ability to strive in the face of adversity. I'm a black, asian, and transman living in a world doesn't necessarily like me, much less want to watch me become successful. Yet, everyday I'm able to push through to not onky help myself, but others also. I hope that one day, I can help create a world where young kids will nevere have to face what I did.
